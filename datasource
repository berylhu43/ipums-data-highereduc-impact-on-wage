 6. Click on the “View Cart” button. Check to make sure you got everything. Click on the
 “Create data extract” button.
 7. Click on “Customize sample sizes.”
 (a) Since we’re dealing with a large sample from the national population, we have far more
 observations than we can easily process. Under “Households,” enter “10” so the dataset
 you create has 10,000 households. This makes working with the data easier, but will
 still give us a “big data” dataset.7
 (b) Click “Submit.”
 8. Click on “Select cases.”
 (a) Since we’re looking at wages as a function of education, we’re only going to keep
 those involved in the labor force. Select EMPSTAT. Just to be safe, let’s also restrict
 our sample by age. Select AGE.
 (b) Click “Submit.”
 (c) Check “Include only those persons meeting case selection criteria.”
 i. Under EMPSTAT, check the box for “Employed” workers.
 ii. For AGE, select ages from 18 to 65.

 version of *.zip), check out “Step 2: Decompress the data file” here:
 https://usa.ipums.org/usa/extract_instructions.shtml (just note that the instructions are
 for the *.dat (text) file and you want the *.csv file)
